As a software engineer, it's important to have a solid understanding of the web stack and its components. One common interview question for software engineering positions is to explain what happens when you type a URL into your browser and press Enter.

Here's a simplified breakdown of what occurs:

DNS request: Your browser sends a request to a DNS server to resolve the URL into an IP address.

TCP/IP: Once your browser has the IP address, it uses the TCP protocol to establish a connection with the server.

Firewall: Incoming traffic is checked by a firewall to ensure it meets security requirements.

HTTPS/SSL: Your browser performs a secure handshake with the server to establish an encrypted connection using HTTPS/SSL protocol.

Load-balancer: If the website is hosted on multiple servers, a load balancer distributes incoming traffic across the available servers.

Web server: Your request is forwarded to the web server that hosts the website.

Application server: If the website runs any applications or has dynamic content, your request is forwarded to the application server.

Database: If the website requires data from a database, the application server sends a request to the database server to retrieve the required data.

In conclusion, understanding the web stack and its components is crucial for any software engineer. Being able to explain the steps involved in loading a website is an important skill that can help you stand out during interviews and grab the attention of potential employers.
